# mkaudiolibrary

Modular audio processing library including MKAU plugin format based on Rust.

# Modules

buffer : includes buffer, push buffer and circular buffer.

dsp : includes convolution, saturation, compression, limit struct and function for audio processing.

processor : includes MKAU plugin format.

# Version

0.3.0 - Reconstructed sized buffer, used slice instead of buffer for plugins.

0.2.3 - Added audiofile module, inspired from Adam Stark's AudioFile library(https://github.com/adamstark/AudioFile).

0.2.2 - Updated lock, unlock, and len for data safety.

0.2.1 - Added lock and unlock for buffer for data safety.

0.2.0 - Updated processor loader and documentation for processor. Added basic compressor, limiter, and delay.

0.1.21 - Modified Buffer for unsafe multithread processing with reference count, appended usage of convolution to any number type, changed I/O of processor.

0.1.20 - Added Deref, DerefMut for buffers.

0.1.17, 0.1.18, 0.1.19 - Corrected processor IO types.

0.1.16 - Changed process function IO to mono. We recommend to use internal buffer for linking.

0.1.15 - Added open_window and close_window and edited example code for Processor.

0.1.14 - Added from_raw function for Buffers.

0.1.13 - Buffers return LayoutError when error occured allocating buffer, added resize, into_slice, and into_slice_mut functions for Buffers.

0.1.12 - Changen I/O type of methonds of simulation and Processor trait into Buffer.

0.1.11 - Added Buffer for simple format of audio buffer. Inline-abled processing functions.

0.1.10 - Used boxed slice for Saturation for block processing. Always inlined processing functions.

0.1.9 - Used boxed slice instead of CircularBuffer for Processor.

0.1.8 - Used boxed slice instead of CircularBuffer for Convolution.

0.1.7 - Create Convolution struct. Dropped next and state reference for processor and convolution.

0.1.6 - Used raw pointer for buffers instead of Box<T>, and implied Drop trait. Minor fix to functions.

0.1.5 - Minor fix.

0.1.4 - Omitted unnecessary multithreading and optional for better performance.

0.1.1 - 0.1.3 - Documentation update.

0.1.0 - Initial version.
